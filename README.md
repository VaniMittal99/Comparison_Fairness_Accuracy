1. data_creation.py  :-
    a) adult_data : The adult dataset is being fethched and divided into train and test after performing stratified sampling.
2. data_utils.py :-
    a) preprocess_adult_dataset : Basic preprocessing of dataset takes place.
3. synthetic_data.py :-
    a) generate_synthetic_data : Synthetic data is generated. 
    b) train_generative_model : GaussianCopulaSynthesizer from SVD library is generated.
4. proxy_classifiers :-
    a) train_proxy_classifier : 3 proxy classifiers are trained.
    b) generate_A_hat_full : A_hat is generated by majority_vote method.
5. evaluate_classifers :-
    a) evaluate_fairness : Module for evaluating all accuracies and fairness constraints.
    b) train_mlp : Module for training MLP classifiers.
    c) train_fair_classifier : Module for Fairness evaluation by Exponentiated Gradient method.
